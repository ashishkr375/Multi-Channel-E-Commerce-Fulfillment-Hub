            We have selected a robust and scalable tech stack for our project:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js, a React framework that allows us to build fast, user-friendly, and SEO-optimized web pages. It provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), ensuring high performance.</li>
              <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express.js for building APIs that integrate various e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Shopify. Express simplifies the server-side logic, while Node.js offers a scalable environment to handle high traffic loads.</li>
              <li><strong>AWS Services:</strong> We use AWS Lambda for running functions in a serverless environment, AWS RDS for relational databases, and AWS S3 for secure storage of data. AWS helps ensure scalability and reliability.</li>
              <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Docker is used to package the application and its dependencies, making deployment consistent across environments.</li>
